Don't believe it? Watch how it works

## Why choose EffortlessTest over writing code for automated tests
Let's face it, writing automated tests is an overhead but also a necessity at the same time. Think about if you could invest 99% of your work time and effort in the application code while the automated tests just consume the remaining 1%.
This is exactly what EffortlessTest aims to achieve - helping you write your tests effortlessly and instantly.

## Why was EffortlessTest created when there are so many API testing tools with a UI available
While sending an API request is easy and straightforward in most of the UI tools, writing assertions is not.
