# It's just Effortless!
EffortlessTest is probably going to be the easiest API testing tool in the world.
Don't believe it? [Watch how it works](https://github.com/vaidkaran/effortless_fe/assets/6270754/2a3579ee-5103-4501-af29-723512fe02ae)

## Why choose EffortlessTest over writing code for automated tests
Let's face it, writing automated tests is an overhead but also a necessity at the same time. Think about if you could invest 99% of your work time and effort in the application code while the automated tests just consume the remaining 1%.
This is exactly what EffortlessTest aims to achieve - helping you write your tests effortlessly and instantly.

## Why was EffortlessTest created when there are so many API testing tools with a UI available
While sending an API request is easy and straightforward in most of the UI tools, writing assertions is not.
